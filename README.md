# Scripts to Make my Life Easier

This is a collection of scripts I have under my `$HOME/bin` and I frequently use.

They are synced on multiple servers I use via `git`.

To use them yourself:

```shell script
cd $HOME
git clone git@github.com:Florents-Tselai/bin.git
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```
